        <p>   A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
            was born on October 15, 1931, in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.</p>
        <p>He served as the 11th President
            of India from 2002 to 2007.</p>
         <p>Kalam earned a degree in
            aeronautical engineering from the
            Madras Institute of Technology and in
            1958 joined the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO).</p>
         <p>In 1969, he moved to the Indian
            Space Research Organisation, where he
            was project director of the SLV-III, the
            first satellite launch vehicle that was
            both designed and produced in India.</p>
            <p> Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
            Kalam planned the program that produced
            a number of successful missiles, which
            helped earn him the nickname <br>
               <b> “Missile Man.”</b></p>
            <p> Among those successes
            was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
            ballistic missile, which incorporated
            aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
            in 1989.</p>
            <p>He also played a
            pivotal organisational, technical,
            and political role in India's<b> Pokhran-II
            nuclear tests</b> in 1998, the first since
            the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
           <p> From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
            was scientific adviser to the defense
            minister, and he later served as principal
            scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
            government with the <b>rank of cabinet minister</b>.</p>
            <p>His prominent role in
            the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
            solidified India as a nuclear power and
            established Kalam as a national hero,
            although the tests caused great concern
            in the international community.</p>
            <p>
                In 1998 Kalam put
                forward a countrywide plan called
                Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                as a road map for transforming India from
                a less-developed to a developed society
                in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                other measures, increasing agricultural
                productivity, emphasizing technology as
                a vehicle for economic growth, and
                widening access to health care and
                education.
